Guidance part:


1) Idea is to match 3D spatial co-ordinates of hand of person pointing finger to object and object itself step by step.

2) When person point towards a object and he/she want to reach there, a button will be clicked which will record co-ordinates of hand and object.

3) These two coordinates will be passed to guidance part which will match x, y and z ordinates step by step and generate commands which will vibrate wrist band.

4)Considering we have four vibrators on wristband,   

   move right = vibrate right 
   move left = vibrate  left
   move up = vibrate top
   move down = vibrate bottom
   Move forward = vibrate any two together

5)Vibrate same sensor twice when co-ordinate is matched successfully.
Vibrate all four when object co-ordinates are matched

6)There will be lapse of 3-10 secs between two commands
